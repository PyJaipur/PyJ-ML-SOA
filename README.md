# PyJ-ML-SOA

PyJaipur “Summer of Algorithm” is a 2 month long Summer of doing program to be conducted in the month of July-August. Through this program, we aim to bring beginners under the guidance of highly skilled people in technology to work, learn and gain knowledge together. 

This repository, meant for the Machine Learning track, contains folders for each of the mentors. Each mentor, who has certain number of mentees under him/her, is supposed to keep a record of their respective mentee's progress. The method of keeping track depends on the mentor.
